# Guide to Contributing

## Team Norms

- Group will ideally be collaborating in-person, however meetings may be held remotely due to scheduling or transportation restrictions. Our primary channel of communication will be via Slack, where we will share debriefs of our team meetings. Each meeting should have all five members present, however a meeting can be held with only three.
- The team will work together by researching design and implementation concepts and share them with the group. The group as a whole will work to decide which of these approaches are the most effective for the project, and these design approaches will be implemented by the team to the best of our ability. Team members who need help are encouraged to express this via Slack, and hold a meeting accordingly. To resolve conflicts, the group will hold a meeting, and if necessary extra help will be solicited from Prof. Bloomberg. Team members are expected to check Slack at least twice daily and respond to messages.
- Sprint lengths will be approximately two weeks as outlined by the course schedule. Daily standups will happen on the first day of a sprint and will last half an hour. All members are expected to attend, if any cannot they will have to affirm the debrief they receive via Slack. As outlined by the course instructions, _a member who makes no progress on a task for two standups or more in a row will be reported to Prof. Bloomberg_. 
- The standard editor will be Visual Studio Code. As outlined by the course instructions: don't over-engineer. _Write minimum code to get things working end to end, only then iterate to improve. Code for each task and spike must be peer-reviewed and pass tests before merging into the main branch of code. Push working code, if you break the pipeline/build then fix it. Make granular and small commits, per feature or per bug fix. Provide descriptive commit messages. Write self documenting code. Use descriptive variable and function names. Avoid unnecessary name shortening. Don't leave dead/commented out code behind. If you see such code, delete it. Write automated tests to cover critical integration points and functionality (once you learn how to do that)_.

## Git Workflow
