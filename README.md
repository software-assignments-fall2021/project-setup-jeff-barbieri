# Virtual Apparel Try-On 

## Product Description and Product Vision Statement
Virtual Apparel Try-On is a web-based application for online shoppers to store their bodily measurements and render them in real-time onto a 3D mannequin. The user can then try on articles of clothing and see how they would fit a body with their given dimensions. The user will be able to try on multiple articles of clothing concurrently and assemble outfits, which they can then add to their cart to purchase. The application will also store the user’s dimensions in their account, as well as their ‘wardrobe’ of items purchased through the app.

## Minimum Viable Product

The Minimum Viable Product is a web-based platform with a 3D mannequin that supports basic measurements, including height, weight, chest, waist, hips, and inseam. The application will support fitting at least one clothing article for each subcategory of the site map, including a shirt, sweatshirt, pants, and shorts. The application should support each of these in a standard number of at least three different sizes.
